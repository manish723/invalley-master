<h3>The power of Social Media for links, engagement and traffic</h3>

<p>
Engage your readers. Build a following. Drive your authority off the charts.
<br /><br />    
These are just a few of the things our social media management service can help you accomplish. Learn how it helps you take control of your market.
<br /><br />
Tweets on Twitter. Facebook updates, Google+ posts, Pinterest pins and more. All these social platforms are now an important part of successfully publicizing and marketing your product. Most attempts, however, are just more noise that potential customers filter and block out. Poor use of social media broadcasts advertising to everybody, but nobody receives the signal. 
<br /><br />
If you want to truly engage your potential customers and clients on these social media platforms, you'll have to do a lot of work. How are you going to find the time to write the tweets, Facebook and Google+ posts, the images and posts you're going to share on Tumblr and Pinterest, when you have a product or service to craft and perfect?
<br /><br />
<strong>Social media is important</strong>, but creating and improving your product is more important and just as, if not more, time-consuming. 
<br /><br />
<strong>So let us tell you how we can help...</strong>
<br /><br />
Our whole social media management service is based on creating the kind of content and developing the relationships that interest your potential customers and make them want to hear from you. Thoughtful and relevant messages from native English speakers. Before telling you more about that, let us show you just why social media is so important below.

    </div>
    </center>
    <p>We are always on the lookout for new information about how websites are ranked and how we can drive more high-quality traffic to our client's websites. <strong>Every indicator points to social media as a critical website ranking signal</strong>. There are many sites that have a low amount of backlinks or that are generally of a lower quality, which are nevertheless climbing the search engine rankings. What is it that propels them so, while their competitors fall behind? You don't need three guesses to know what - it's the signals coming from social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and others. 
    <br /><br />
    <font style="font-style: italic;">Here is an example we recently studied which shows the potential power of using social media to improve your rankings:</font>

<h3 class="mt-md-5">Social media engagement the simple way</h3>

    <p>How can Invalley help you improve your presence on social media? It's really quite simple - we'll do everything for you. From the time-consuming work of setting up accounts, crafting the posts for the various social networks, linking to your website, product, or service, to engaging with your followers and getting your message out to the digital world. All this without you having to type a single message yourself, letting you focus on improving your product or service. 
        <br /><br />
    There are no shortcuts, no automated “bots” that post lifeless-sounding messages or tweets – we know how important it is to provide quality content and information when engaging with social media users. Here is how we do it.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Matching your message to your followers</h3>

    <p>We let you choose which of the categories you want to use for your business. We recommend choosing multiple categories to make sure your Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Pinterest feed is interesting and engaging. Categories: <font style="font-style: italic;">News and Trends, Call to Action, General Interest, Statistics, Appeal to Senses, Request for Response, Trivia, Pictures, Videos and Audio, Special Event, Announcements, Daily Calendar, Future and Technology and Social Giving</font></p>

<h3>Step 2: Writing high-quality, custom posts</h3>

<p>We then create custom messages to match your business. We use a combination of quotes, news, engaging comments, media, and your marketing messages. Readers keep following you because they enjoy the news and ideas you are sharing.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Social Links to your website</h3>

<p>Social media is an important method of adding new backlinks to your site and building links to deeper content on your site, too. All of the search engines, Google not least among them, are paying attention to links from social media. You get to choose how often we use your URL in the posts, or if you just want to use your social media accounts for client engagement.</p>

<h3 class="mt-md-5">What's included with the Social Links service?</h3>

    <p>We'll help you with four social media platforms – Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Pinterest. Each of these has its own specific culture and style, and we'll make sure to use it effectively.
<br /><br />
If you already have a profile on one, some, or all of these sites, we can use that, or make a new, full profile from scratch. In addition, we can post using your company name or as a third party.
<br /><br />
You get to <strong>decide what kind of content you want us to post</strong>. We'll also link the social media together, so that people who follow your Twitter feed will know about your Facebook, Google+, and Pinterest pages as well.
<br /><br />
We can also <strong>track the number of visitors to your site</strong> by using bit.ly links. Every click-through is registered, so we will be able to find out how many people are going to your website, analyze the traffic, and make any changes to the content of the message that are deemed necessary. Finally, you can schedule how often you want the messages to be posted – once a day, twice a day, three times a week – you can tell us, and we'll make it work!
<br /><br />
        <strong>Twitter</strong>
<br /><br />
- We'll post 30 tweets a month, or 1 per day.<br />
- We'll follow 30 new Twitter profiles that are relevant to your niche.<br />
- Five retweets of high-quality posts by others.<br />
- Five outreaches to authoritative industry people.<br />
- Creation of a full profile with avatar if you don't have one already.<br />
<br />
        <strong>Facebook</strong>
<br /><br />
- We'll craft 10 to 20 Facebook updates per month for posting.<br />
- We'll create a full profile, with biography, information, and pictures so that people are convinced of its authenticity.<br />
<br />
        <strong>Google+</strong>
<br /><br />
- We'll craft and share 10 posts on Google<br />
- We'll create a full profile, with biography, information, and pictures so that people are convinced of its authenticity.  <br />   
<br />
        <strong>Pinterest</strong>
<br /><br />
- We'll pin and share 10 interesting posts with images.<br />
